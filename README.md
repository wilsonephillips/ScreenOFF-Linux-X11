# ScreenOFF-Linux
Tells your monitor to go directly into powersave mode. This is pretty handy sometimes. Just hit a key or move the mouse to bring the monitor back to life.

I drop the file into my ~/scripts folder and drop a shortcut to it on the desktop. Don't forget that it needs to be exucutable to run.


This one does not seem to work anymore. I really need to take some time to see if I can fix it.
